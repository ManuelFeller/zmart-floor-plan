# Zmart Floor Plan

Zmart Floor Plan is a php script that helps you to draw a floor plan with the status of your [Z-Way](https://z-wave.me/z-way/) Smarthome devices:

As you see it is a bit more focused on a technical view - but after all this is more easy to "read" then a huge list of things that you may even have to scroll for.

So if you have a server with php running in your home network feel free to re-use what I have already done.

The floor plan is generated from an XML configuration file (see [demo.xml](demo.xml)) - this way you can adjust your setup without the need to change any code files.


## Add your own elements

Have a look at the [Extension Guide](doc/extension.md) to learn more about how you can add new smart things that are drawn on the floor plan...

## Background

I started working on this in 2016 when I wanted to have a better overview of my Smarthome-Sensors - and it did a nice job until I moved to a new place in 2018.  
Then, in early 2021 I had to touch it again as I finally reactivated it for my new apartment - and thought that this (as having a graphic overview is still no default feature of Z-Way) might also be interesting for other users.

So I decided to do some final polishing and documenting of the current state and then publish it on GitHub.
I also have some plans to maybe enhance it a bit more (at least I want to add a few more elements and options as my range of sensors and actors grew a bit).

More information will be added soon...
